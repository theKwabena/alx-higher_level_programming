- How is Python `for` different from `C`
- How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
- How to use `range`
- What is a f you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any `return` statement
- Scope of variables
- What's a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
## Tasks file and description:
  * [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py): Python program that assigns
  a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and
  prints whether `number` is positive or negative.
  * Prints the number followed by:
    * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    * If the number is 0: `is zero`
    * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * Followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py).

  * [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py): Python program that assigns a random signed number
  to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints its last digit.
  * Prints the string `Last digit of [number] is [last_digit]` followed by:
    * If thppppppr than 5: `and is greater than 5`
    * If the number is 0: `and is 0`
    * If the number is less than 6 and not 0: `and is less than 6 and not 0`
    * Followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py).

  * Using only one `print` and one loop.
  * Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.
  * Printing format: `[decimal] = [hexadecimal]`

  * [5-print_comb2.py](./5-print_comb2.py): Python program that prints numbers from `0`
  to `99` two digits each.
  * Numbers are separated by `, `, except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.
  * Using no more than two `print` functions and one loop.
  * Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.

  * [6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py): Python program that prints all possible
  different combinations of two digits in ascending order.
  * Numbers are separated by `, `, except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.
  * The two digits must be different - `01` and `10` are considered identical.
  * Using no more than three `print` functions and two loops.
  * Without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing modules.

  * [7-islower.py](./7-islower.py): Python function that checks for lowercase characters.
  * Returns `True` if `c` is lowercase, `False` otherwise.
  * Without importing modules or using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.

  * [8-uppercase.py](./8-uppercase.py): Python function that prints a string in
  uppercase followed by a new line.
  * Using no more than two `printone loop.
  * Without importing modules or using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.

  * [9-print_last_digit.py](./9-print_last_digit.py): Python function that prints the last
  digit of a number.
  * Returns the value of the last digit.
  * Without importing modules.

  * [10-add.py](./10-add.py): Python function that returns the addition of two integers.
  * Without importing modules.

  * [12-fizzbuzz.py](./12-fizzbuzz.py): Python function that prints the numbers from
  `1` to `100` followed by a space.
  * For multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number.
  * For multiples of five,nstead of the number.
  * For multiples of three and five, `FizzBuzz` is printed instead of the number.
  * Without importing modules.

  * [13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c): C function that inserts a number
  into a sorted linked list.
